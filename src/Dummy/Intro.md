## What is Vuex?
Vuex is a state management library designed specifically for Vue.js applications. It helps manage the state of an application in a centralized store, making it easier to track changes, debug, and share data between components.

## Why Vuex? It has several handy features such as
* Centralized State: Organize and manage your app's state in one place.
* Predictable: All state changes are explicit and follow a predictable flow.
* Developer Tools: Vuex comes with powerful tools for time-travel debugging and state inspection.
* Scalability: As your application grows, Vuex provides a structured way to manage complex state and business logic.
## When to Use Vuex?
* When your app grows and state management between components becomes difficult.
* When passing props or emitting events becomes cumbersome in larger applications.
* For centralized data that needs to be shared or mutated across different parts of the app.
## Components of Vuex - These are 
* State: The single source of truth (global application data).
* Getters: Compute derived state based on the state.
* Mutations: Functions that directly mutate the state.
* Actions: Functions that can perform asynchronous operations and commit mutations.
* Modules: Break up state management into separate modules for larger applications.
## In this tutorial, weâ€™ll explore how to get started with Vuex, its core concepts, and best practices for integrating it into your Vue.js application.

1. node_modules/
This is where all your project's dependencies are stored after you run npm install or yarn install.
It's not something you typically modify directly.
2. public/
Contains the public assets for your project. 
index.html is the main HTML file of your app. This file contains the root <div id="app"></div> where your Vue app will be mounted.
3. components/:

This is where you define Vue components (reusable units of your UI).
4. App.vue:
This is the root component of your Vue application. It's like the "main container" for the UI of your app.
5. main.js 

The entry point for your Vue app.
