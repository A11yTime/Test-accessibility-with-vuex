In this guide, you've learned how to:

Set up Vuex to manage state in a Vue.js application.
Define the Vuex store with state, mutations, actions, and getters.
Fetch data using an action in the Vuex store, and update the state accordingly.
Access and display the fetched data in a Vue component, along with handling loading and error states.
Vuex helps to centralize the state management and makes it easier to share state across multiple components, especially in larger applications.

# State: The state object stores the data and UI states (like loading or error) that we want to manage.

users: This stores the fetched user data.
loading: This tracks whether the app is fetching data.
error: This will hold any error message if the API request fails.
# Mutations: Mutations are used to modify the state.

setUsers: Sets the fetched user data.
setLoading: Toggles the loading state.
setError: Sets an error message if the fetch fails.
# Actions: Actions handle asynchronous operations and commit mutations.

fetchUsers: Fetches the data from an API (in this case, jsonplaceholder), and commits the appropriate mutations based on the result.
# Getters: Getters are used to extract state in a reactive way.

allUsers: Gets all users from the state.
isLoading: Gets the loading state.
errorMessage: Gets the error message.

State Mapping (mapState): We map the state from Vuex to computed properties. This makes the users, loading, and error state available in the template for rendering.

Action Mapping (mapActions): We map the fetchUsers action to the component's methods, allowing us to dispatch the action in the mounted lifecycle hook.

Mounted Hook: The mounted() lifecycle hook is used to dispatch the fetchUsers action once the component is mounted.

Loading and Error Handling: We conditionally display a "Loading..." message while data is being fetched and an error message if the fetch fails.
